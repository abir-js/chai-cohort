# Beginner's Guide to Web Development Jargon

Starting a web development journey as a beginner can be overwhelming, especially when you encounter complex technical concepts and jargon. A significant portion of a beginner’s energy is often spent simply trying to understand these terms. Let’s make this learning journey easier by breaking down some frequently used tech jargon into simple, beginner-friendly language.

## Most Frequently Used Tech Jargons

### 1. Protocols
A set of rules that define how data is transmitted between devices on internet.

- You can think of it as like dress-code in schools and colleges, it is fixed and you have to always maintain it.

### 2. Client
The user or device that requests information or services from a server.

- You go to a shop and asks for chocolate, so you are the client. 

### 3. Server
A continuously running computer system that responds to requests made by clients.

- The shokeeper who gives you chocolate is server.
- But for server systems, it should always running, because nobody knows when the client will make any request.

### 4. User Agent
Commonly known as the browser, it sends requests to the server on behalf of the user.

### 5. IP (Internet Protocol)
The address of a machine on the internet, similar to a home address for computers.

### 6. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
Commonly called a link, it’s a human-readable address used to locate a website.

### 7. URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
A broader term that includes links (text), files, images, and other resources.

### 8. DNS (Domain Name System)
A protocol for converting a URL into its corresponding IP address.

### 9. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
A protocol for transferring images, audio, video, files, and other resources on the web.

### 10. HTTP 2.0
An advanced version of HTTP where all related documents for a request are sent in a single connection, improving speed and performance.

### 11. HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
An encrypted and more secure version of HTTP.

### 12. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
The protocol used to establish encrypted and secure connections for HTTPS.

### 13. TLS (Transport Layer Security)
An advanced and more secure version of SSL.

### 14. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
A protocol that sends data without establishing a connection, used for faster data transfers like video streaming.

### 15. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
A protocol used to transfer information reliably over the internet by ensuring data is delivered accurately and in order.

### 16. Endpoint
A specific URL or location on a server where a client can send requests.

### 17. Payload
The actual data transferred between the client and the server.

### 18. Request
Information or data that the user asks for from the server.

### 19. Response
The information or data sent by the server to fulfill a user’s request.

### 20. Cookies
Small pieces of data stored by a website on the user’s browser, such as login credentials or preferences. If exposed, cookies can lead to security risks like hacking.

### 21. Session
Since HTTP and HTTPS do not inherently store user states, a session is used to store temporary information about the user, such as login status or browsing history.
